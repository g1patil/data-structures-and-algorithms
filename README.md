# Data Structures and Algorithms ain Java

This repo contains the standard Data Structure and Algorithm question for coding interviews. The major focus is on the Leetcode platform.
Feel free to fork/contribute/share/createissue or ask any question. Majority of the algo are tested. The class are annotated with details about status. 

You can also refer to my [Java Notes](http://blog..com/category/java) for a quick refresh on the Java concepts. Lastly, feel free to connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ram__patra) for any queries or concerns. All the best!
